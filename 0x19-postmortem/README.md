Impact:

🌐 Affected Service: Our beloved Web Application
😱 User Experience: Users had a rollercoaster ride of intermittent connections and slow responses. It was the digital equivalent of rush hour traffic on the internet highways.
📉 Percentage of Users Affected: About 20% of users, who experienced more buffering than a bad Netflix stream.

Root Cause:

🔍 The Great Database Adventure: Unbeknownst to us, our database had a momentary identity crisis, juggling more connections than a magician with too many hats. The result? A symphony of errors and chaos.

The Epic Timeline of Triumph and Tribulation:

🚨 Issue Detection:

Time:January 17, 2024, 3:15 PM (UTC)

How: Our vigilant monitoring system, the unsung hero of our tech tale, sent an alert faster than your grandma forwarding chain emails.

🕵️‍♂️ Actions Taken:

🛠️ The tech squad embarked on a quest, donning their debugging capes and wielding keyboards like swords.
🧐 Investigated database logs, server metrics, and the mystical realm of recent code deployments.
🤔 Assumed the code gremlins might be at it again, causing mischief in the sacred code scrolls.

🤪 Misleading Investigation Paths:
🕵️‍♀️ Explored the dark arts of recent code deployments, suspecting foul play.

🌐 Thought maybe the internet goblins were staging a protest.

🕵️‍♂️ Considered the possibility of a DDoS attack—turns out, it was just our adoring users showing too much love.

🚀 Escalation:

📢 Called upon the wise Database Administration and DevOps wizards for counsel. It was time to unite the tech clans!

🛠️ Resolution:
💡 Identified the real culprit: too many connections, a classic case of social distancing violation in the database realm.

🔧 Applied a quick fix by optimizing database connection settings, teaching our database some manners.

💻 Conducted a code exorcism to banish any inefficient queries to the netherworld.

🚑 Deployed a hotfix to reinforce our defenses, because when in doubt, add more firewalls.
