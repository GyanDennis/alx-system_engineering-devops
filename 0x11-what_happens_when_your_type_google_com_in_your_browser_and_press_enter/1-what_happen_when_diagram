DNS Resolution: When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, your computer needs to find the IP address associated with this domain name. It sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name to an IP address.Request to Server IP: Once the browser has the IP address, it sends an HTTP request to the server IP on the appropriate port, which is typically port 443 for HTTPS.Traffic Encryption: To ensure secure communication, the traffic is encrypted. This is indicated by "https://" in the URL, which signifies that a secure SSL/TLS connection is established.Firewall: The traffic passes through a firewall, which is a security measure to filter and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed.Load Balancer: Many high-traffic websites like Google use load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. Load balancers help with scalability and redundancy.Web Server: The load balancer directs the request to a web server. The web server handles the HTTP request, retrieves the requested web page, and sends it back as an HTTP response.Application Server: In some cases, an application server is involved. It generates the web page dynamically, processing data or performing specific actions before sending the page to the web server.Database Interaction: If the web page requires data from a database (e.g., search results on Google), the application server requests this data from the database server. The database server processes the request and sends the necessary data back to the application server.
